      "
      It is late, very late. Everyone else in the castle has gone to bed, but you are still awake. The candle by your desk flickers, and then goes out. You think you hear something—or maybe it’s just your imagination. Then, you hear it again. Slowly, the hairs on your arm stand up…  
      Suddenly, a ghost appears before you, a mere foot from your face. You yelp in fright, then have to bite your tongue to keep from screaming again as more ghosts appear, until they surround you. The ghosts are all dressed in fine clothes, and some are wearing crowns. Familiar crowns… 
      The ghost directly before you sighs. “<Ruler> <PlayerName>,” it intones. “We are the ghosts of rulers past. We have come to warn you…” It raises its spectral arms, and you see a gruesome stab wound in its side. “Do not make the same mistakes we did! Heed your people, rule wisely but fairly, learn from our mistakes…”
      The ghosts crowd closer in around you. Your teeth are chattering. They do not seem as though they are going to leave anytime soon. What do you do?
