      - choiceText: "Dragons are sentient creatures, right? Perhaps you can reason with it? You’ve been told you have a silver tongue. You just hope that doesn’t mean the dragon will want to take it."

      - choiceText: "There’s no hope of defeating this beast. Perhaps you can offer it a gift of gold or food to placate it and keep it from further ravaging the kingdom. It will have to be a fairly significant gift, though..."
