      "There is a long bitter history of the nobles and merchants and even at times the <king> disrespecting your peasant class. 
      They have poked fun at your low status, lack of wealth, and general impoverished state. Enough is enough, it is time to claim our dignity back and there is one perfect way to do so. 
      One word: farmer’s strike
      Will you join the strike and force the merchants and nobles to acknowledge the importance and significance of your class by refusing to farm the food the kingdom heavily relies on?”
