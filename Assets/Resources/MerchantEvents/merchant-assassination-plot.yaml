      "The merchant class has had enough of the <Ruler> <PlayerName>â€™s wishy-washy decisions on whether or not to engage in warfare with BeepBoop. 
      Meanwhile, the merchant class is slowly disintegrating and more and more formerly wealthy merchants are now losing their land and wealth. 
      The merchant class has decided to unite and through a special deal with the nation of BeepBoop, if they sacrifice <Ruler> <PlayerName> and assassinate the king then the war talks will cease, a new ruler will be crowned, and trade may commence freely.
      
      Will you begin the plot to assassinate <Ruler> <PlayerName> for the hope of a better kingdom?"
