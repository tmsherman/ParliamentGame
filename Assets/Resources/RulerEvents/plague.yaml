        outcomeText: "\"Wise choice,\" the old woman mysteriously smiles. \"The plague has been averted and the peasants rejoice! However, nobles and merchants have had to pay a hefty price for the magical cure through taxes on their scones, so I would be careful in the future to not further anger them.\""
