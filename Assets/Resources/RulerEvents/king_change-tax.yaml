      "A proposal for a new tax has just come from the noble court. The tax will help increase the power of the court, but may put a strain on the wealth-earning classes.
      You can approve the new tax. You can suggest a change to the tax bill, but the nobles will have to approve this change. Or you can veto the tax -- but that may ruffle some feathers among the nobles."

      # if the tax passes, it will increase power at the expense of wealth
      # we want the stremer to negotiate with the noble and merchant audience members to pick one choice or the other
