      "There is an ominous feeling in the air. The people in the town square are uneasy as they feel something terrible about to happen. The kingdom has been on the decline, the classes are unsettled and there is much political unease.
        Suddenly, an old widow whispers to you. \"<Ruler><PlayerName>, if you do not take action quickly the kingdom will crumble under a plague that is worse than man’s diseases, it will take down classes and create unrest and quite likely dethrone you. May you make the wise decision.\"
        What are you going to do to prevent this plague?"
