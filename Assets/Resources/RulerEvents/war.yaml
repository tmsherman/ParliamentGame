      "You are a ruler that prides yourself on your superb sense of humor, according to your court jesters, of course if they ever offended you they probably would be banished or worse. 
      Anyways, perhaps this time you crossed the line. The neighboring country of BeepBoop has declared war on your country after being deeply offended by one of your crude jokes on the name of their country. 
      Quoting the ruler of BeepBoop’s court secretary, your Royal Highness would not stop screeching, \“BeepBoop, BeepBoop out of my way you slow drivers, whilst imitating a wagon through repeated pleading attempts to stop.\” 
      BeepBoop has a history of a staunch pride in their name and have no tolerance for taunting. 
      What are you going to do, Your Royal jester, ahem, Highness?"

        outcomeText: "Your rash words now face the consequences of a prideful nation. BeepBoop was a fierce enemy but you manage to barely scrape a victory. However, your kingdom has lost a great deal of wealth and your diplomacy skills are now very poor. People are unhappy, but at least the peasants that rose up during the war benefitted by raising their social status and joined the merchant class."
