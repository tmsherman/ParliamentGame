      "There is a noise growing outside your palace. It sounds like a crowd, screaming. No... singing.
      Your advisor pokes her head into your thrown room, face pale. \"Your highness! Do you hear the people sing?\"
      \"Sing what?\" you ask, just before the noise reaches an unbearable level. Suddenly, the doors to your throne room burst open and your advisor is pushed aside by a mob of peasants.
      \"Viva la revolution!\" the lead peasant screams.
      As the mob evicts you from your throne, you wonder if you could've seen this coming. This is what you get for giving peasants rights--they get ideas. And then do them.

      You have been overthrown by the pesants' popular revolution. So ends your reign. Maybe they'll let you be a citizen now?"
